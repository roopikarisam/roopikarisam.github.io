Roopika Risam is an Associate Professor of Secondary and Higher Education and English at Salem State University. She also serves as the Faculty Fellow for Digital Library Initiatives, Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Digital Studies, and Coordinator of the Combined B.A./M.Ed. in English Education.

Her research interests lie at the intersections of postcolonial and African diaspora studies; humanities knowledge infrastructures; and digital humanities.

Risam's first monograph, [_New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy_](../ndw) was published by Northwestern University Press in 2018. She is the co-editor of [_Intersectionality in Digital Humanities_](../intersectionality) (Arc Humanities/Amsterdam University Press, 2019). Risam's co-edited collection [_The Digital Black Atlantic_](../dba) for the Debates in the Digital Humanities series (University of Minnesota Press) is forthcoming in 2020. Her current book project, ["Insurgent Academics: A Radical Account of Public Humanities,"](../insurgent-academics) traces a new history of public humanities through the emergence of ethnic studies.

Her scholarship has appeared in _Digital Scholarship in the Humanities_, _Digital Humanities Quarterly_, _Debates in the Digital Humanities_, _First Monday_, _Popular Communications_, and _College and Undergraduate Libraries_, among other journals and volumes.

Risam is currently developing [_The Global Du Bois_](../global-du-bois), a data visualization project on W.E.B. Du Bois. She also co-directs _Reanimate_, an intersectional feminist publishing collective recovering archival writing by women in media industries, and co-hosts _Rocking the Academy_, a podcast featuring conversations with the very best truth tellers, who are formulating a new vision of higher education.

A former member of the Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH) and Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) executive boards, Risam was the co-chair of the ACH 2019 conference. She also received the Massachusetts Library Association's inaugural Civil Liberties Champion Award for her work promoting equity and justice in the digital cultural record.
