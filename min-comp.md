title: "Minimal Computing Special Issues"
---

I am co-editing a special issue of _Digital Humanities Quarterly_ on Minimal Computing with Alex Gil. The multilingual call for papers is available [here](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/blog/2019/11/12/cfp-dhq/).

This issue will bring together essays and case studies on the promises and limitations of minimal computing from historical, practical, and theoretical perspectives, as well as within the context of specific research projects and their environments.

Minimal computing can be defined as any form of digital or computational praxis done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, agency or other factors. Within the context of digital humanities scholarship, minimal computing refers to such computing practices used for teaching, research, and the construction and maintenance of a hybrid – digital and analog – scholarly and cultural record.
