I am available for talks, workshops, virtual class visits, and consultations on my areas of expertise: race, difference, and digital cultures; globalization and technology; migration and media; pedagogy and technology; and social media and public scholarship. Drop me a note to discuss your needs and interests or just to chat!

I can be reached via email at [roopika [dot] risam [at] dartmouth [dot] edu](mailto:roopika.risam@dartmouth.edu). You can also find me on Twitter [@roopikarisam](http://twitter.com/roopikarisam).
