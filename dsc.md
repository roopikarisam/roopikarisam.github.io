[![Photo of the Data-Sitters Club logo](../assets/images/dsc-small.png){:style="float: right; margin-left: 3px;"}](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/) Along Quinn Dombrowski, Katia Bowers, Maria Cecire, and Anouk Lang, a group of fellow _Baby-Sitters Club_ books fans, I'm a founding member of [_The Data-Sitters Club_](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/).

Together, we're assembling a comprehensive, colloquial guide to computational textual analysis, using a corpus of - you guessed it - Ann M. Martin's iconic teen girl series _The Baby-Sitters Club_. From creating a corpus to experimenting with methods and tools to answer critical questions about children's literature, genre fiction, and digital humanities itself, we're walking readers through computational textual analysis from A to Z.
