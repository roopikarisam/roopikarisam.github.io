[_Reviews in Digital Humanities_](http://reviewsindh.pubpub.org) is a journal I co-edit with Jennifer Guiliano to facilitate scholarly evaluation for digital humanities work and its outputs.

The goal of _Reviews in Digital Humanities_ is to foster critical discourse about scholarship in a format useful to other scholars. The journal publishes project overviews written by project directors alongside peer reviews written by members of digital humanities communities. Projects submitted for review are also listed in our project registry, unless otherwise requested by project directors.

Projects within the scope of _Reviews in Digital Humanities_ may include, but are not limited to: digital archives, multimedia or multimodal scholarship, digital exhibits, visualizations, digital games, digital tools, and digital projects. Most critical, however, is that the outputs selected for review in this journal blend humanistic and technological inquiry.
