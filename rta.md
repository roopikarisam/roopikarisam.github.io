[![Logo for Rocking the Academy](../assets/images/rta-small.jpg){:style="float: right; margin-left: 3px;"}](https://rocking-the-academy.simplecast.com/) [_Rocking the Academy_](https://rocking-the-academy.simplecast.com/) is a podcast that I co-host and co-produce with Mary Churchill.

_Rocking the Academy_ brings listeners conversations with the very best truth tellers who are formulating a different vision of the university. Do they rock the boat? Yes. But, in doing so, they rock the academy.

Season 1 of _Rocking the Academy_ launched in Fall 2019 and features Paula Krebs, Lee Skallerup Bessette, Alex Gil, Kelly J. Baker, Schuyler Esprit, Katie Rose Guest Pryal, and Bryan Alexander.

Look for Season 2 in Spring 2020.
