The common thread that runs throughout my research agenda is my commitment to creating and sustaining humanities knowledge infrastructures that foreground Black, brown, and Indigenous voices. As the humanities and higher education face an uncertain future, I draw on my background in African diaspora studies, ethnic studies, postcolonial studies, and intersectional feminism to explore multi-faceted approaches that allow us to imagine new futures grounded in reciprocal and redistributive relationships with our communities. We find glimpses of this future at the confluences of digital humanities, public humanities, and community-engaged scholarship.

At the heart of my research is the concern that while digital knowledge production has accelerated rapidly in the last few decades, the exclusions and biases that have long shaped print culture — products of colonialism, racism, and patriarchy — are being reproduced and amplified as we construct the digital cultural record of humanity. Representation alone will not address these issues. Therefore, my scholarship examines the methodologies, reward structures, labor models, and ethics of research necessary for more fully realizing the promise of knowledge production in the digital age. Questions I explore include: How do we facilitate ethical humanities collaborations that transcend boundaries between "university" and community"? How do we reframe humanities "knowledge" and "expertise" in ways that recognize that they are not the sole domain of faculty but are distributed throughout communities within and beyond academia? How do we ensure faculty reward systems value interdisciplinary and engaged scholarship and recognize that humanities outputs need not be limited to the monograph, journal article, or book chapter? And how do we best plan for the long-term survival of the humanities in case we can't rely on the fragile institutions that sustain them?

My research agenda is perhaps best understood through five interconnected strands where I explore these questions: digital ethnic studies, critical university studies, intersectional feminist media, scholarly communications, and media and migration. As my books, articles, and digital projects nimbly cross over these categories, together they comprise a series of investigations — at both large and small scales, in multiple genres — of how to build humanities knowledge infrastructures based not on rehearsing the dominant white epistemologies of the Global North but on putting Black, brown, and Indigenous people at the center.

## Digital Scholarship

[_Torn Apart/Separados_](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index) was developed in collaboration with the Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research (Manan Ahmed, Alex Gil, Roopika Risam, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira), Borderlands Archives Cartography (Sylvia Fernández, Maira Álvarez), Merisa Martinez, Linda M. Rodriguez, and Rachel Hendery, and presents data visualizations of the geographical and financial landscape of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the United States.

[_Social Justice and the Digital Humanities_](http://criticaldh.roopikarisam.com) was created as the culminating project in the HILT 2015 De/Post/Colonial Digital Humanities course I taught with micha cárdenas. Designed as an invitation to discuss and implement digital humanities methods that put justice and equity at the center of digital scholarship, the project offers users a series of creative and critical precepts for project design around access, material conditions, method, and ontologies and epistemologies for scholarship.

[_The Harlem Shadows Project_](http://harlemshadows.org), which I direct with Chris Forster, is an open access critical edition of Claude McKay's 1922 poetry collection _Harlem Shadows_. The project seeks to aggregates the most comprehensive set of documents related to the collection and make them available to readers of McKay.

## Editorial Work

[_Reviews in Digital Humanities_](../reviews) is a peer-reviewed journal for digital scholarship that I co-edit with Jennifer Guiliano. The journal was launched in 2019.

["Digital Humanities and South Asian Studies"](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoa20/40/3?nav=tocList) is a special issue of _South Asian Review_ that I co-edited with Rahul Gairola. The issue was published in 2019.

["Gender and Digital Labor"](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/590) is a special issue of _First Monday_ that I co-edited with Carolyn Elerding and Radhika Gajjala. The issue was published in 2018.

["Gender, Globalization, and the Digital Humanities"](https://adanewmedia.org/issues/issue-archives/issue8/) is a special issue of _Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology_ that I edited. The issue was published in 2015.
