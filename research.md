My research agenda focuses on scholarly communications, digital pedagogy, and humanities knowledge infrastructures, through postcolonial and intersectional feminist lenses. Digital humanities, the interdisciplinary area of study in which I situate my work, connotes a set of practices for using digital tools for humanistic inquiry and using humanities methods to understand digital media and technologies. At the heart of my work is the concern that while digital knowledge production has accelerated rapidly in the last few decades, the exclusions and biases that have characterized print culture - products of colonialism, racism, and patriarchy - are being reproduced and amplified in the digital cultural memory of humanity. The broader goal of my research is to call attention to these issues and to work collaboratively with colleagues to redress them.

A copy of my CV is available [here](../RisamCVNovember2019.pdf).

## Digital Scholarship

[_Torn Apart/Separados_](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index) was developed in collaboration with the Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research (Manan Ahmed, Alex Gil, Roopika Risam, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira), Borderlands Archives Cartography (Sylvia Fernández, Maira Álvarez), Merisa Martinez, Linda M. Rodriguez, and Rachel Hendery, and presents data visualizations of the geographical and financial landscape of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the United States.

[_Social Justice and the Digital Humanities_](http://criticaldh.roopikarisam.com) was created as the culminating project in the HILT 2015 De/Post/Colonial Digital Humanities course I taught with micha cárdenas. Designed as an invitation to discuss and implement digital humanities methods that put justice and equity at the center of digital scholarship, the project offers users a series of creative and critical precepts for project design around access, material conditions, method, and ontologies and epistemologies for scholarship.

[_The Harlem Shadows Project_](http://harlemshadows.org), which I direct with Chris Forster, is an open access critical edition of Claude McKay's 1922 poetry collection _Harlem Shadows_. The project seeks to aggregates the most comprehensive set of documents related to the collection and make them available to readers of McKay.
