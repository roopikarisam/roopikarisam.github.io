The common thread that runs throughout my research agenda is my commitment to creating and sustaining humanities knowledge infrastructures that foreground Black, brown, and Indigenous voices. As the humanities and higher education face an uncertain future, I draw on my background in African diaspora studies, ethnic studies, postcolonial studies, and intersectional feminism to explore multi-faceted approaches that allow us to imagine new futures grounded in reciprocal and redistributive relationships with our communities. We find glimpses of these futures at the confluences of digital humanities, public humanities, and community-engaged scholarship.

The future of the humanities, in my world, lies not in the work of professors but in the communities to which we are accountable. I put this belief into practice through my research collaborations with K-12 teachers on the North Shore of Massachusetts, in which we explore how technologies can engage students in literature, history, and art; how we can improve students' data literacy while teaching them about Black, brown, and Indigenous writers and thinkers whose voices have been unheard; and how writing with digital media can empower minoritized students to tell their stories. The results of these collaborations, which have included revised curricula and digital projects, are preparing today's young people to be stewards of the humanities in the future.

At the heart of my research is the concern that while digital knowledge production has accelerated rapidly in the last few decades, the exclusions and biases that have long shaped print culture — products of colonialism, racism, and patriarchy — are being reproduced and amplified as we construct the digital cultural record of humanity. Representation alone will not address these issues. Therefore, my scholarship examines the methodologies, reward structures, labor models, and ethics of research necessary for more fully realizing the promise of knowledge production in the digital age. Questions I explore include: How do we facilitate ethical humanities collaborations that transcend boundaries between "university" and community"? How do we reframe humanities "knowledge" and "expertise" in ways that recognize that they are not the sole domain of faculty but are distributed throughout communities within and beyond academia? How do we ensure faculty reward systems value interdisciplinary and engaged scholarship and recognize that humanities outputs need not be limited to the monograph, journal article, or book chapter? And how do we best plan for the long-term survival of the humanities in case we can't rely on the fragile institutions that sustain them? This institution-building work naturally traverses boundaries between research, teaching, and service.

My research agenda is perhaps best understood through five interconnected strands where I explore these questions: [digital ethnic studies](../research#digital-ethnic-studies), [critical university studies](../research#critical-university-studies), [scholarly communications](../research#scholarly-communications), [intersectional feminist media](../research#intersectional-feminist-media), and [media and migration](../research#media-and-migration). As my books, articles, and digital projects nimbly cross over these categories, together they comprise a series of investigations — at both large and small scales, in multiple genres — of how to build humanities knowledge infrastructures based not on rehearsing the dominant white epistemologies of the Global North but on putting Black, brown, and Indigenous people at the center.
