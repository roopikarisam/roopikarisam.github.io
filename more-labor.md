This chapter offers a critique of the use of crowdsourced labor in digital humanities scholarship. From the ethics of collaboration to the exploitation of workers on platforms like CrowdFlower and Amazon Mechanical Turk that pay pennies for piecework, the integrity of scholarship, this essay argues, is compromised by reliance on these labor sources.

Co-authored with Susan Edwards, this chapter outlines common obstacles to librarian-faculty partnerships at regional comprehensive universities, including the lack of models for this digital humanities work and the difficulty of fostering ethical collaboration.

Co-authored with Justin Snow and Susan Edwards, this article examines the work of building a digital humanities community at Salem State's library. The article outlines a three-pronged approach: laying the groundwork to build a digital humanities center, focusing on place-based digital scholarship, and launching an undergraduate internship program to explore ethical ways of creating innovative research experiences for students.
