[![Photo of the cover of Roopika Risam's book New Digital Worlds](../assets/images/intersectionality.jpg){:style="float: right; margin-left: 3px;"}](https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9781641890502/intersectionality-in-digital-humanities)[_Intersectionality in Digital Humanities_](https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9781641890502/intersectionality-in-digital-humanities), which I co-edited with Barbara Bordalejo, was published by Arc Humanities/Amsterdam University Press in 2019.

The volume originated in the Intersectionality in Digital Humanities conference arranged by Bordalejo at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium in October 2016. The volume intervenes in emerging scholarly conversations about the value of intersectional feminist thought for digital humanities by examining the add-and-stir model of diversity often misguidedly deployed in digital humanities, the hidden histories of intersectionality within digital scholarship, and the growing community of scholars putting intersectionality at the forefront of digital research methods in the humanities. We further shed light on difficult conversations about equity and justice in digital humanities practices by considering the challenges faced by scholars because of their identities and the foci of their scholarship, as well as the structural barriers within digital humanities professional communities. What the volume offers is not a final statement on intersectionality in digital humanities but a contribution to the beginning of a critical scholarly conversation.

Contributors include: Moya Bailey, Kimberley Beasley, Barbara Bordalejo, Kyle Dase, Vera Fasshauer, Dorothy Kim, Amalia S. Levi, Daniel O'Donnell, Roopika Risam, Peter Robinson, and Adam VÃ¡zquez.
